# Simulation algorithms for "Stability and Instability of the MaxWeight Policy"

This repository contains the code used to generate some figures contained in the publication  
[M. Bramson, B. D'Auria and N. Walton (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10825), _Stability and Instability of the MaxWeight Policy_.


## Setup

After cloning the repository, install a python virtual environment

- On macOS and Linux:
```python3 -m venv env```

- On Windows:
```py -m venv env```

Activate it
- On macOS and Linux:
```source env/bin/activate```
- On Windows:
```.\env\Scripts\activate```

Install the dependencies  
```pip -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the scripts, execute one of the following commands
- ```python Rybko-Stolyar_network.py``` (To make Figures 2 and 3),
- ```python multiclass_network.py``` (To make Figure 7),
- ```python variablespeed_singleclass_network.py``` (To make Figure 8).

To get help, execute the command with the option ```--help```.  
This option lists all the available parameters that can be passed to the script via the command line.  
 
For example:
```{python}
> python Rybko-Stolyar_network.py --help

Usage: Rybko-Stolyar_network.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --a FLOAT             Mean arrival rate
  --nu INTEGER          Mean service rate.
  --J INTEGER           J+1 is the number of queues of each component.
  --init-A0 INTEGER     Queue length at queue A0.
  --init-Aj INTEGER     Queue length at queue Aj.
  --init-B0 INTEGER     Queue length at queue B0.
  --init-Bj INTEGER     Queue length at queue Bj.
  --runtime INTEGER     Discrete time simulation length.
  --save-to-file TEXT   Enable saving pictures to files.
  --output-dir TEXT     Set the output directory for pictures.
  --seed INTEGER        Seed used to generate random quantities.
  --av INTEGER          Windows parameter to compute moving averages.
  --version TEXT        Suffix to append to the output files. Example: "v1"
  --cut TEXT            Visualize the cut region.
  --level INTEGER       Denote a which level to start the cut.
  --cache TEXT          Read the simulation data form a file.
  --cache-dir TEXT      Set the cache directory for simulations.
  --record TEXT         Record simulation data and pictures to files.
  --debug TEXT          Enable debugging behaviour.
  --show-progress TEXT  Show percentage of simulation completed.
  --help                Show this message and exit.
