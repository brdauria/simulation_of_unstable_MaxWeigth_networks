# Simulation algorithms for "Stability and Instability of the MaxWeight Policy"

This repository contains the code used to generate some figures contained in the publication  
[M. Bramson, B. D'Auria and N. Walton (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10825), _Stability and Instability of the MaxWeight Policy_.


## Setup

After cloning the repository, install a python virtual environment

- On macOS and Linux:
```python3 -m venv env```

- On Windows:
```py -m venv env```

Activate it
- On macOS and Linux:
```source env/bin/activate```
- On Windows:
```.\env\Scripts\activate```

Install the dependencies  
```pip -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the scripts, execute one of the following commands
- ```python Rybko-Stolyar_network.py``` (To make Figures 2 and 3),
- ```python multiclass_network.py``` (To make Figure 7),
- ```python variablespeed_singleclass_network.py``` (To make Figure 8).

To get help, execute the command with the option ```--help```.  
This option lists all the available parameters that can be passed to the script via the command line.  
 
For example:
```{python}
> python Rybko-Stolyar_network.py --help

Usage: Rybko-Stolyar_network.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --a FLOAT                       Mean arrival rate
  --nu INTEGER                    Mean service rate.
  --J INTEGER                     J+1 is the number of queues of each
                                  component.
  --init-A0 INTEGER               Queue length at queue A0.
  --init-Aj INTEGER               Queue length at queue Aj.
  --init-B0 INTEGER               Queue length at queue B0.
  --init-Bj INTEGER               Queue length at queue Bj.
  --runtime INTEGER               Discrete time simulation length.
  --save-to-file / --no-save-to-file
                                  Enable saving pictures to files.  [default:
                                  True]
  --output-dir TEXT               Set the output directory for pictures.
  --seed INTEGER                  Seed used to generate random quantities.
  --av INTEGER                    Windows parameter to compute moving
                                  averages.
  --version TEXT                  Suffix to append to the output files.
                                  Example: "v1"
  --cut / --no-cut                Visualize the cut region.  [default: True]
  --cut-level INTEGER             Denote a which level to start the cut.
  --cache / --no-cache            Read the simulation data form a file.
                                  [default: True]
  --cache-dir TEXT                Set the cache directory for simulations.
  --record / --no-record          Record simulation data and pictures to
                                  files.  [default: True]
  --debug / --no-debug            Enable debugging behaviour.  [default:
                                  False]
  --show-progress / --no-show-progress
                                  Show percentage of simulation completed.
                                  [default: True]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Example of outputs
When the Python scripts are called with the ```--save-to-file``` option enabled, 
they will save in the ```--output-dir``` the output pictures in ```.pdf``` and ```.jpeg``` formats.

In the following the pictures that are obtained by calling the scripts with the default parameters are shown.
These same pictures were used in the publication  
[M. Bramson, B. D'Auria and N. Walton (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10825), _Stability and Instability of the MaxWeight Policy_.
